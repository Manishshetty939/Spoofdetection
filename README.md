# Spoofdetection

This project implements a basic Iris Spoof Detection System using Python and OpenCV 

Feature:
it enables real time web cam
I used house circle transform to detect iris region
It measures texture variation over time using standard deviation(SD)

Requirements :
pip install opencv-python numpy

Note:

The detection accuracy depends on lighting, camera resolution, and eye visibility.
This is a basic spoof detection approach
